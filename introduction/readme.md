## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for backup administrators or consultants managing Veeam
Backup & Replication on a daily basis.

Most sections of this guide assume you already have hands on experience with
Backup & Replication, and will serve as an "advanced user guide", meaning
that more basic usage information, system requirements and the like must be
found in [User Guide in Veeam Helpcenter](https://www.veeam.com/documentation-guides-datasheets.html).

Service providers delivering BaaS and DRaaS with Veeam Cloud Connect should
refer to the corresponding
[Veeam Cloud Connect Book](https://www.vccbook.io/) or [Veeam Cloud Connect Reference Architecture](https://www.veeam.com/wp-cloud-connect-reference-architecture-v9.html).
